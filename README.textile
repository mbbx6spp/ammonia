h2. Overview

Provides Nitrogen applications an easier more consistent Rails-like environment 
to develop in...explain more later.

h2. Background

Smell anything? It might be a bad code smell in your Nitrogen application. 
Are you writing too much setup code for each and every Nitrogen web app you 
write? The answer _might_ be to use Ammonia to provide set conventions for 
organizing your Nitrogen web app code.

Whether you love it, hate it or are somewhere in between, Rails does one thing 
very, very well: provide a way to organize your web application consistently
so you can switch between Rails applications and be fairly sure where to find 
certain types of code.

h2. Tell me more...

As a former Rails, Merb and even TurboGears developer in a previous pre-Erlang 
life, I found one thing very refreshing about these frameworks and that was 
that they offered a consistent project structure for each new application. I 
knew exactly where to find global application settings, environment specific 
settings, application initializers, plugin dependency definitions, views, 
controller logic,  persistence mapping code, etc.

For example, in Rails the following files & dirs contain code for specific 
purposes:
* #{RAILS_ROOT}/config - root directory for all configuration code
* #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/initializers - initializer code
* #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/environments - environment specific code
* #{RAILS_ROOT}/config/routes.rb - defines routes for web application

Creating a consistent project layout (that eventually could be customized), 
which also fits into the Erlang/OTP and Rebar conventions will be the goal of 
the Ammonia project.

h2. Timeline

Expect a few updates in the next 2 weeks of February 2011, but also note that 
I am up against some big deadlines at work until May 2011.
